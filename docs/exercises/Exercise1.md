# Excercise I

## Setup
- Install Go from golang.org inside a virtual disk (.vhdx on Windows or .sparseimage on Mac) in a /software/go subdirectory.
- Create a Go workspace on the disk in the /codebase/gopath directory (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCsL89YtqCs)
- Create a shell script (.sh / .cmd) to make your changes to the GOPATH and PATH environment variables persistent.
- Create a Github project with your personal account containing a HelloWorld.go programm
- Use go get https://github.com/\<\<YOUR REPO\>\> to copy the repository into your local GOPATH.
- Test the HelloWorld programm with "go run HelloWorld"

- Use go get https://github.com/jweigend/concepts-of-programming-languages/ to copy this repository to your local GOPATH.
- Run the Makefile (with make) and test the slides with "make slideshow"



## After this Exercise
- You should be able to compile and run Go code
- You should know about the GOPATH and PATH variables
- You should have a clean Go installation inside a seperate disk on your computer
- Your personal Github project is cloned into your workspace. You are able to add and remove files
