# Exercise 10 - Go Modules

Write a Go module mail with API and impl
The Mail implementation should log a message with logrus(https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) 

Change your module dependency to a former logrus version

Write a second Go module client which uses the mail module

Make a incompatible change to your mail API and increase the major version number
