* Types of Programming Languages
- *Imperative*: Assembler as root (Operations and Control Structures)
- *Declarative:* Domain Specific Languages (HTML, XML, YAML, ...) => Limited in scope. Some are not Turing Complete. 
- *Procedural* (Control Structures and Procedures): Fortran / Algol / Pascal / *C*
- *Object* *Oriented* (Classes and Objects): Smalltalk / Objective C / C++ / Eifel / *Java* / C#
- *Functional* (Lambdas + Closures): Haskell, Erlang, F# 
- *Logic*: Prolog
- *Best* *of* *Breed*: Kotlin, Scala, Rust, JS, *Go*

* Areas for Programming Languages
- Application Programming (small / large scale, web, central, cloud)
- Systems Programming
- Network Programming / Distributed Systems 
- Realtime Systems
- User Interface Programming
- Embedded Systems 

* Orthogonal Classifications
- Static vs. Dynamic Typed
- Compiled vs. Interpreted
- Sequential vs. Parallel
- Static Linked vs. Dynamic Linked
- Safe vs. Unsafe (Crash a process or even the system)
- Simple vs. Complex
- Platform Independent Bytecode vs. Platform Dependent Assemblercode
- Plattform Dependent Compiler vs. Cross Compiler

* Some Thoughts
- There are many solutions for a given problem
- The "best" language is nothing without a proper ecosystem (Libraries, Examples, Community)
- There are straight forward choices for a given platform (Mac: Swift + Objectiv-C, Linux: C + Python, Android: Java)
- Dont expect "Magic" from programming Languages
- Clean code and good programming is orthogonal to the language
- Learn more than one programming language at a professional level
