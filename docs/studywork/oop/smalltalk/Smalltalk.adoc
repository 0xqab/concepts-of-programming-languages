= Compare Object Orientated Programming in Go with Smalltalk 
Daniel Voß <daniel.voss@kabelmail.de>


== Introduction
Smalltalk is a pure object-oriented programming language 
and was designed and created in 1970s by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, 
Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Scott Wallace and Peter Deutsch. 
It influenced the development of following languages like Objective-C, 
Java and Ruby and so it also has some influence on the programming language Go. 

Smalltalk is even more than a programming language it is an Interactive Programming 
Environment because it comes with its own Virtual Machine (VM) where the integrated 
development environment (IDE), the interpreter and all libraries necessary for the language are integrated. 
That means a project with Smalltalk is developed in its own VM like Squeak <<sque>> or Pharo <<pharo>>.

In the following sections the language will be explained with the main aspect on object orientation and compared 
to the language Go. The code examples in this article are written in Pharo, a modern dialect of Smalltalk that 
implements the language very close to Smalltalk-80.


== Syntax
The Syntax of Smalltalk aim to be near a normal but minimalized English sentence. There are only 
six keywords reserved in the language: _nil, true, false, self, super,_ and _thisContext_. The rest like if 
else expressions and creation of classes are achieved by implementing it with the language itself.

|===

In the static typed programming language Go every variable is has a data type. 
In the dynamically typed language Smalltalk - as it can be seen in the declaration example for 
temporary variable - variable do not have a data type. That means every object can be assigned 
to every variable without any cast.

Therefore, array also can store every object. For literal arrays the members must be constant at 
compile time. Dynamic array are defined at runtime (They only are available in newer dialects of Smalltalk).

Blocks are like Anonymous Functions in Go. A block is an object - like everything in Smalltalk - and can 
be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument and is executed with the message _value_ (see Message).

== Object Orientation Concept
In Go Object orientation can be achieved but it is not a must. Smalltalk is pure object oriented and 
therefore much stricter with rules for object orientation. The rules are: (<<And11>>)

* Everything is an object. 
* Every object is an instance of a class. 
* Every class has a superclass. 
* Everything happens by sending messages. 
* Method lookup follows the inheritance chain.

These are the essential rules that will be deeper explained in the following sections. 


== Messages
In Smalltalk the communication between objects happens through messages. How an object reacts to a 
message is determined by the class of that object. Not all messages respond successful to all messages. 
How to respond to a message must be defined in the class or a subclass. When a message is send to a receiver 
another object is always returned.

There are three types of messages:

* unary message:

These are messages that don’t require any argument and have the form receiver messageName.  
For example _5 sqrt_ sends the message _sqrt_ to the object _5_. An integer object _25_ will be returned.

* binary messages

These messages take one argument and is used for operations, often arithmetic like:
_3 * 4_ this expression sends the message _*_  to the object _3_ with the argument _4_ and will return a new object _12_

* keyword messages

These messages require one or more arguments that are send to the receiver. For every argument is a 
keyword ending with _:_. For example 
_10 between: 5 and: 15_ sends a messages with two arguments to the object _10_ and it will returns true.

Messages can be send successively. Without brackets the sending priority is Unary > Binary > Keyword. Messages 
with the same priority are send from left to right. With only these three priorities the expression _3 + 2 * 4_ returns _20_ 
and not like in Go 11.

<<<

Messages can be compared to method calls in Go but the main difference is, that in Smalltalk the receiver choose how he responds to the message.
In Go keywords for if-else statements and loops are reserved. Smalltalk does not have such keywords, and even that happens 
by sending messages to objects. 

 myValue < 17 ifTrue: [ blockTrue ] ifFalse: [ blockFalse ].
 
Here first the binary message _<_ with the argument _17_ is send to the object _myValue_. That will return an instance of the class _True_ or _False_. 
Now the message is send to that object. Depending on the class of the object it will execute the first or second argument 
(first or second block).In a similar way loops are implemented, just by sending a message to an object that reacts to that message.

== Classes
A class can be defined like:

[source,smalltalk]
----
Object subclass: #Person
	instanceVariableNames: 'surname age’
	classVariableNames: 'count'
	package: 'Peoples'
Person>> age
	^ age
Person>> age: anObject
	age:= anObject
----
	
A class has instance variables and class variable. In the example were _surename_ and _age_ as instance variables 
defined and _count_ as class varaible. Instance variables are unique for each instance of that class, class variables are shared by every instance. 

The behaviour of the object from a class is defined by its methods. A method determines how an object 
reacts to a received message. In the example only two methods are implemented, the getter and setter for the instance variable _age_. 

In Smalltalk it is not possible to declare the access of a variable or method like it is done in Go with 
upper or lower letter. In Smalltalk every method is public, and every variable is protected. It is protected 
because subclasses that inherit from a class have also access to all variables. Therefore, like done in the example 
getter and setter have to be defined to access them from outside or from their metaclass (see metaclass).  

As pointed out before the creation is achieved with the language itself - else like Go that uses for the purpose 
of defining a class the keyword _struct_ - because it can be read as sending a message with four arguments to the 
object called _Object_. This will create a unique instance of a metaclass for the defined class (see section Metaclass) 
which now can create instances of this defined class. 

<<<

== Inheritage and Polymorph
Every class inherits from a single superclass. That means Smalltalk has a clear class tree beginning with ProtoObject. 
Usually it inherit from _Object_ or an subclass like:

[source,smalltalk]
----
Person subclass: #Teacher
	instanceVariableNames: 'subject'
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'Peoples'
Teacher>>age
	^(age - 1)
----

Here a new subclass _Teacher_ is created that inherits from _Person_. That means an instance of _Teacher_ will have 
the same instance variable as an instance of _Person_ and additional the variable _subject_. It will also share the same class variable. 

The subclass can define new methods and override or expand existing methods.In the code example the method age is overritten.
To expand a method, the old message just has to be send to the superclass with the keyword _super_ and then add the new functionality.

When a message is send to an object it will first look for a method to handle the message.When no suitable method is 
fund the search continuous in the superclass and goes up the inheritance chain until a method is found. 

Because Go decided against an inheritance tree like Smalltalk such functionality can be achieved by embedding. 

Interfaces like known in Go are not necessary in Smalltalk because Smalltalk is dynamically typed and no type checked 
for arguments is done. A handed argument can be everything.

== Metaclass
As pointed out before in Smalltalk everything in Smalltalk is an object and every object is an instance of a class. 
Because Smalltalk is consequence with that rule classes are object too. That means even classes are an instance of a class, 
called metaclass. By creating a class with _subclass:_ - as described before - a hidden metaclass and a unique instance of it 
is created. 
That concept might be at first a bit unfamiliar for an Go programmer but it will be clearer and just a logic continuation of 
Smalltalks rules with the following example. Most of the time one does not even have to care about metaclasses. 

By sending the message _new_ to this instance of metaclass an instance of the class is returned. For the abouve example:

  t1 := Teacher new.

will create a _Teacher_ object and saves it in the variable _t1_. From this point of view, it is almost equal to Go’s New but what 
happens in the background differs. As New in Go is a keyword, the creation of an instance in Smalltalk is defined by the language just by 
sending the message _new_ to an object -an instance of a metaclass -.

To completely fulfil the rule every metaclass is an instance of _Metaclass_. Even the metaclass of Metaclass is an instance of the class 
_Metaclass_. That relation is shown in illustration Figure 1 for the abouve generated teacher t1.

.All instances realtion and inheritage relation for _t1_ (adaptet from <<pharo>> Chapter 13)
[#img-Metaclass]
[caption= Figure 1:  ]
image::Metaclass.jpg[]

One can also change the behaviour of the instance of the metaclass. For that most of the common IDS have a button to switch 
to the “class side” view of a class. Here for example constructors can be implemented:

[source,smalltalk]
----
Person class>>initialize	
	count := 0.
Person class>>new 	
count := count +1.
	^super new.
Person class>>new: aAge
	| person |
	person := self new.
	person age: aAge.
	^person
----
	
That code expression implements a constructor for a Person. 
Every time an instance of Person or Teacher is created the _count_ variable is incremented. Initialize is executed the first 
time a _new_ message is send for this object.

As it may at first view scare programmer new to that concept it shows that Smalltalk is a pure 
object orientated language and is very strict with its concept. 

<<<

== Conclusion
Smalltalk is an interesting programming language because of its strict object orientation and the messaging system. 
It was designed for educational use what can be seen because it is easy to learn with only a few keywords, close to the 
englisch language and only focuse on one way of programming - object oriantaion - where else Go might be harder to learn because its 
possibility to code in more ways.

For a Go or even Java or C++ programmer testing Smalltalk might change the way one think about object orientation. 
To see how strong that object orientation can be implemented and also learning about the beginning of the object orientation 
that might be implemented in ones favorite language.

There are also some problems with the programming language. The Go developers had a reason when not to implement large 
inheritance chain when looking back on existing lanuages.

Another problem is, that on common implementations of the language everything, 
including development and workspace runs in an VM. On the first view and for testing the lanuage out, that might be an advantage 
because everything is combine in one software - what also supports the purpose for education - but that makes it harder to 
include new libraries, share code and work on several PCs on one project. 

One can learn a lot by testing out Smalltalk but it might be not the language for every bigger commercial project.
